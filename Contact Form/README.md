# 📬 Contact Form

## 🔍 Overview

The **Contact Form** is a simple yet essential web development project that captures user input (such as name, email, and message) and validates it on the client side. This project was crafted with the goal of mastering **HTML5 forms**, **CSS styling**, and **JavaScript validation** — all fundamental for building real-world websites.

Though it's a minimal interface, the Contact Form offers a real opportunity to understand user experience design, accessibility, and input sanitization — critical concepts in frontend development.

## 💡 Use Case

This project simulates the type of contact section you'd find on a real business, portfolio, or landing page. It serves as a **launchpad** to learn:

- Form submission patterns
- Error feedback UX
- Integration with email services or backend APIs

You can easily extend this by:
- Sending form data to a Google Sheet or database
- Adding reCAPTCHA for bot protection
- Building an admin dashboard to review submitted messages

## 🧾 Sample Validation Logic (JavaScript)

```javascript
function validateForm() {
  const name = document.getElementById("name").value.trim();
  const email = document.getElementById("email").value.trim();
  const message = document.getElementById("message").value.trim();

  if (!name || !email || !message) {
    alert("Please fill in all fields.");
    return false;
  }

  if (!email.includes("@")) {
    alert("Please enter a valid email address.");
    return false;
  }

  alert("Form submitted successfully!");
  return true;
}
