# 🛬 Landing Page

## 🔍 Overview

The **Landing Page** project is a visually structured single-page layout built to simulate real-world marketing or product-focused pages. It includes sections like hero banners, call-to-action buttons, feature highlights, and a responsive layout — everything you'd expect from a modern, conversion-oriented landing page.

This project was designed to strengthen my understanding of **HTML semantics**, **responsive layout grids**, and **visual storytelling through code**.
