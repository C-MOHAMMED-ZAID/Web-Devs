# Responsive Grid

This project showcases a responsive grid layout built using modern CSS Grid techniques. The grid automatically adapts to different screen sizes, making it ideal for displaying content such as cards, images, or articles in a flexible and visually appealing way.

## Features

- **CSS Grid Layout:** Utilizes the powerful CSS Grid module for creating complex, two-dimensional layouts with minimal code[3][4].
- **Mobile-First Design:** The grid starts as a single column on small screens and expands to multiple columns as the viewport grows[4][6].
- **Automatic Column Adjustment:** Uses `auto-fit` and `minmax()` to let the grid adjust the number of columns based on available space, often eliminating the need for explicit media queries[4][6].
- **Consistent Gaps:** Maintains uniform spacing between grid items for a clean and organized appearance[4].
- **Content-Driven Breakpoints:** Adapts to content needs rather than targeting specific devices, ensuring future-proof responsiveness[6].

## Purpose

This project was created to learn and practice responsive layout techniques using CSS Grid. The goal is to understand how to build layouts that look great and function well on any device, without relying on frameworks.

## How It Works

- The grid container is set to `display: grid` and uses `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));` to automatically create as many columns as will fit, with each column being at least 300px wide[4][6].
- As the screen size changes, the number of columns adjusts dynamically, and grid items reflow to fit the available space[4][6].
- Uniform gaps between items are managed with the `gap` property for visual consistency[4].
- The layout is mobile-first, ensuring usability and readability on small screens before enhancing for larger displays[4][6].

## Usage

You can use this responsive grid as a foundation for galleries, product listings, card layouts, and more. Simply add your content as grid items, and the layout will handle the rest.
