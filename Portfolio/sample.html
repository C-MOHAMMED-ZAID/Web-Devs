        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="Photo.png" alt="my image" class="profile">
        <p>Iâ€™m Zaid, a dedicated MCA student in my second year at MIIT with a keen interest in becoming a full-stack web developer. I am passionate about creating innovative web solutions and have hands-on experience with core technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My expertise extends to modern frameworks and tools including React.js, Node.js, and Express.js, and I am well-versed in database management with SQL, MySQL, and MongoDB.

            In addition to my web development skills, I possess intermediate knowledge in Python, C, and C++, and am familiar with data analysis frameworks like Matplotlib, NumPy, and Pandas. My experience also includes basic knowledge in software testing, including manual testing and automation using Selenium and Postman.
            
            Throughout my academic journey, I have developed several projects, including an employee management app, an event ticket booking system, a weather forecasting application, and a news aggregator. These projects have allowed me to apply my skills in both fundamental web development and the MERN stack.
            
            My goal is to leverage my diverse skill set to excel as a software developer and tester, contributing to impactful and high-quality software solutions. I am excited to explore opportunities that allow me to grow and make a meaningful impact in the tech industry.</p>
