# Responsive Card

This project demonstrates a simple and effective responsive card component, designed using HTML and CSS. Responsive cards are widely used in modern web design to showcase content such as articles, product details, user profiles, or features in a visually appealing and mobile-friendly manner.

## Features

- **Fully Responsive:** The card layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring optimal viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices[1][3][4].
- **Clean Design:** Modern look with soft shadows, rounded corners, and balanced spacing for a professional appearance[3][4].
- **Customizable Content:** Easily replace the image, title, description, and button to fit your specific needs[3].
- **Interactive Hover Effects:** Subtle animations enhance user engagement and highlight interactivity[3].

## Purpose

This project was created as a hands-on learning exercise to understand the fundamentals of responsive web design, CSS Flexbox/Grid, and card-based layouts. The goal is to practice building reusable UI components that look great on any device.

## How It Works

- The card uses a flexible container and media queries to automatically adjust its width and layout based on the screen size[1][4].
- On larger screens, multiple cards can be displayed side by side; on smaller screens, cards stack vertically for readability[3][4].
- Hovering over a card may trigger a visual effect, such as a border or shadow animation, to indicate interactivity[3].

## Usage

You can integrate this responsive card into your own projects to display content in a structured and visually appealing format. Itâ€™s ideal for portfolios, product showcases, team sections, and more.
