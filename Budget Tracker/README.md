# Personal Budget Tracker (HTML-Only)

# Live Demo - https://c-mohammed-zaid.github.io/BudgetTracker/

## Overview

This project is a simple personal budget tracker web application built exclusively using HTML. It's designed as a hands-on learning tool for individuals to grasp and reinforce HTML fundamentals, focusing on structuring content, creating forms, and displaying data in tables [1][2][3][4].

The application allows users to:

*   Input income and expense entries via an HTML form [1][3].
*   Categorize transactions using dropdown menus [3].
*   View a basic summary of their budget in a table format [1][4].

## Features

*   **Semantic HTML Structure:** Employs semantic HTML5 tags such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` to provide a meaningful structure to the content, enhancing accessibility and readability [3][4].
*   **HTML Forms:** Demonstrates the use of various form elements like `<input>` (for text, numbers, dates), `<select>`, `<textarea>`, `<radio>`, and `<checkbox>` to collect user data for income, expenses, categories, and dates [1][3].
*   **HTML Tables:** Illustrates how to present data in a structured format using `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` elements for displaying a budget summary [1][4].
*   **Inline Styling (Basic):** Shows how to use inline styles (`style` attribute) to apply basic formatting directly to HTML elements, understanding the limitations and use cases [1].
*   **Clear Content Organization:** Organizes content into distinct sections with clear headings, creating a logical flow for users [3].

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** The only language utilized for building the entire project, emphasizing a focus on core HTML concepts [1][2][3][4].

## Sections of the Budget Tracker

### Header Section

*   Uses the `<header>` tag for the website's title (e.g., "Personal Budget Tracker") and navigation links (optional, e.g., links to Add Expense, View Budget) [3].

### Introduction Section

*   Uses a `<section>` tag to introduce the purpose of the tracker [3].
*   Includes a heading (`<h1>`) for the title and a paragraph (`<p>`) explaining how the tracker works [3].

### Add Income/Expense Section

*   Uses a form (`<form>`) for users to input their income and expenses [3].
*   Includes form elements such as number inputs, dropdown menus, date inputs, and a submit button [1][3].

### Budget Summary Section

*   Displays a table (`<table>`) that shows a summary of all income and expenses entered by the user [1][4].
*   The table includes columns for Category, Amount, Date, and Type (Income or Expense) [4].

### Footer Section

*   Includes a footer with information about the tracker, such as the version number [1].

## Purpose

This project serves as a practical exercise for:

*   **Learning HTML Tags:** Understanding the purpose and usage of fundamental HTML elements, including headings, paragraphs, lists, and semantic tags [3].
*   **Creating Forms:** Practicing the creation of HTML forms, incorporating different types of input fields like numbers, dates, and dropdowns [3].
*   **Structuring Tables:** Learning how to structure data effectively using the `<table>` tag, along with `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` [4].
*   **Understanding Semantic HTML:** Exploring how semantic HTML elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<section>` enhance webpage accessibility and readability [3].
*   **Organization:** Organizing HTML structure to create a logical flow and user-friendly interface [3].
*   **Reinforcing HTML Basics:** To be strong in all tags [3].

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```
    git clone [repository URL]
    ```

2.  **Open in Browser:** Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.

3.  **Interact with the Application:** Use the form to add income/expense entries, and view the budget summary in the table.

## Limitations

*   **No Data Persistence:** The entered data is not stored and will be lost upon refreshing the page [1].
*   **Limited Styling:** Without CSS, the visual appearance is very basic [1].
*   **No Interactivity:** Without JavaScript, the form submission doesn't actually do anything beyond a page refresh (no data processing) [1].

## Future Enhancements (Beyond the Scope of This Project)

*   **CSS Styling:** Add CSS (either inline, internal, or external) to improve the visual appearance and create a responsive layout [1].
*   **JavaScript Functionality:** Implement JavaScript to handle form submissions, data validation, and dynamic table updates [1].
*   **Data Storage:** Integrate a backend database and server-side language (e.g., PHP, Python) to store and retrieve data [1].
*   **User Authentication:** Add user authentication to secure user data [1].

## Code Style

*   Follow proper indentation and HTML syntax [3].
*   Ensure all tags are properly closed and nested [3].
