# Navigation Bar

This project is a simple and responsive navigation bar built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates the fundamentals of building navigation menus for websites, including layout, styling, and interactive elements.

## Features

- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- Clean and modern look with smooth hover effects
- Easy to customize and integrate into any web project
- Basic JavaScript for toggling the menu on smaller screens

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to learn and practice how to create navigation bars for web applications. Itâ€™s intended as a beginner-friendly exercise to solidify understanding of HTML structure, CSS styling, and simple JavaScript interactivity.

## How It Works

- The navigation bar displays a list of links horizontally on larger screens.
- On smaller screens, the menu collapses into a hamburger icon.
- Clicking the hamburger icon toggles the visibility of the navigation links.

## Usage
