# 🍔 Hamburger Menu

## 🔍 Overview

The **Hamburger Menu** project is a responsive navigation component that transforms from a horizontal navbar to a collapsible menu icon on smaller screens. This project was built to explore real-world mobile navigation patterns using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It’s a must-know technique in modern web development and is often used in portfolios, landing pages, and full-scale web apps. For me, this was a key project to learn how UI components can adapt to different devices through logic and layout.
