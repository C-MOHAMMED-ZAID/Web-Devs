# 🦶 Footer Section

## 🔍 Overview

The **Footer Section** project is a simple HTML/CSS component built to explore how to design, position, and style responsive website footers. While it may look small, this project reflects a deep dive into **semantic markup**, **layout control**, and **mobile-first design**.

It was created as part of a larger learning effort to master foundational UI components by building them one at a time — the footer being one of the most overlooked yet essential parts of any modern website.
