# 🎨 Background Generator

## 🔍 Overview

The **Background Generator** is a beginner-friendly web application that dynamically creates linear gradient backgrounds based on user input. It’s built with core frontend technologies and was developed as a hands-on project to deepen my understanding of DOM manipulation, CSS styling, and JavaScript events.

This project is intentionally simple — its main purpose is **to learn by building**. It helped me grasp how to control visual elements of a webpage using user-driven inputs.
